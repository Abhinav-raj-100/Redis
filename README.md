In this challenge, I build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

**Note**: Feel free to try out this project with me! You can reach out to me through my LinkedIn profile: www.linkedin.com/in/abhinav-raj-0b34a6224.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your Redis implementation is in `src/main/java/Main.java`.


That's all!
